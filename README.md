## 1. End-to-End Forgery Detection (Raw Audio-Based Models)

### **Key Technical Innovation**
- Directly processes raw waveforms without requiring feature extraction.
- Uses deep learning models like **RawNet**, which leverages 1D convolutional networks for end-to-end learning.
- Captures fine-grained temporal patterns and phase information that may be lost in traditional spectrogram-based methods.

### **Reported Performance Metrics**
- **Equal Error Rate (EER):** ~1.75% (on ASVspoof 2019 dataset)
- **Detection Accuracy:** 98% (in controlled environments)
- **Inference Speed:** Suitable for near real-time detection (optimized implementations achieve sub-100ms inference time per sample).

### **Why This Approach?**
- **Real-time Potential:** Eliminates the need for pre-processing, reducing computation overhead.
- **High Generalization:** Works well across different AI-generated speech models.
- **Robustness to Variability:** Learns directly from data, making it adaptable to unseen deepfake attacks.

### **Challenges & Limitations**
- **Computational Cost:** Requires significant GPU resources for training.
- **Dataset Dependence:** Performance can degrade on unseen datasets without retraining.

## 2. Hybrid Feature-Based Detection (Spectrogram + Deep Learning)

### **Key Technical Innovation**
- Combines handcrafted spectral features (MFCC, log-Mel spectrograms) with deep neural networks like **LCNN (Light Convolutional Neural Network)**.
- Uses spectrogram-based representations to detect anomalies in speech frequency content.

### **Reported Performance Metrics**
- **EER:** ~2.50% (on ASVspoof 2021 dataset)
- **Detection Accuracy:** 96% (real-world conversational data)
- **Inference Speed:** Moderate (~150ms per sample, depending on hardware optimizations).

### **Why This Approach?**
- **Balanced Performance:** Achieves good accuracy with relatively low computational requirements.
- **Explainability:** Spectrogram-based features allow for visualization of anomalies.
- **Proven Success:** Commonly used in audio deepfake detection research.

### **Challenges & Limitations**
- **Preprocessing Overhead:** Requires feature extraction, making real-time deployment slightly challenging.
- **Sensitivity to Noise:** Background noise and different recording conditions may impact accuracy.

## 3. Feature Fusion-Based Detection (ResNet + Multi-Feature Extraction)

### **Key Technical Innovation**
- Uses a **ResNet-based deep learning model** combined with multiple feature representations (e.g., spectral, phase, energy-based).
- Fuses various feature types to enhance detection robustness.

### **Reported Performance Metrics**
- **EER:** ~1.85% (on AVspoof dataset)
- **Detection Accuracy:** 99% (synthetic vs. real speech classification)
- **Inference Speed:** Moderate (~120ms per sample with optimized inference pipelines).

### **Why This Approach?**
- **Enhanced Robustness:** Combines different features to improve generalization.
- **Better Adaptability:** Can be fine-tuned for different datasets.
- **Works on Real Conversations:** Can be optimized for streaming speech analysis.

### **Challenges & Limitations**
- **Computationally Intensive:** Needs more processing power due to multi-feature fusion.
- **Requires Model Optimization:** Can be complex to implement efficiently in real-time environments.

## Conclusion
Each approach has strengths and trade-offs:
- **For real-time performance:** **End-to-End Raw Audio Models** are preferable.

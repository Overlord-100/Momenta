# Audio Deepfake Detection - Promising Approaches

## Overview
This document outlines three promising forgery detection approaches for detecting AI-generated human speech in real-time scenarios. Each approach is evaluated based on key technical innovations, reported performance metrics, applicability to real conversations, and potential challenges.

## 1. End-to-End Forgery Detection (Raw Audio-Based Models)

### **Key Technical Innovation**
- Directly processes raw waveforms without requiring feature extraction.
- Uses deep learning models like **RawNet**, which leverages 1D convolutional networks for end-to-end learning.
- Captures fine-grained temporal patterns and phase information that may be lost in traditional spectrogram-based methods.

### **Reported Performance Metrics**
- **Equal Error Rate (EER):** ~1.75% (on ASVspoof 2019 dataset)
- **Detection Accuracy:** 98% (in controlled environments)
- **Inference Speed:** Suitable for near real-time detection (optimized implementations achieve sub-100ms inference time per sample).

### **Why This Approach?**
- **Real-time Potential:** Eliminates the need for pre-processing, reducing computation overhead.
- **High Generalization:** Works well across different AI-generated speech models.
- **Robustness to Variability:** Learns directly from data, making it adaptable to unseen deepfake attacks.

### **Challenges & Limitations**
- **Computational Cost:** Requires significant GPU resources for training.
- **Dataset Dependence:** Performance can degrade on unseen datasets without retraining.

## 2. Hybrid Feature-Based Detection (Spectrogram + Deep Learning)

### **Key Technical Innovation**
- Combines handcrafted spectral features (MFCC, log-Mel spectrograms) with deep neural networks like **LCNN (Light Convolutional Neural Network)**.
- Uses spectrogram-based representations to detect anomalies in speech frequency content.

### **Reported Performance Metrics**
- **EER:** ~2.50% (on ASVspoof 2021 dataset)
- **Detection Accuracy:** 96% (real-world conversational data)
- **Inference Speed:** Moderate (~150ms per sample, depending on hardware optimizations).

### **Why This Approach?**
- **Balanced Performance:** Achieves good accuracy with relatively low computational requirements.
- **Explainability:** Spectrogram-based features allow for visualization of anomalies.
- **Proven Success:** Commonly used in audio deepfake detection research.

### **Challenges & Limitations**
- **Preprocessing Overhead:** Requires feature extraction, making real-time deployment slightly challenging.
- **Sensitivity to Noise:** Background noise and different recording conditions may impact accuracy.

## 3. Feature Fusion-Based Detection (ResNet + Multi-Feature Extraction)

### **Key Technical Innovation**
- Uses a **ResNet-based deep learning model** combined with multiple feature representations (e.g., spectral, phase, energy-based).
- Fuses various feature types to enhance detection robustness.

### **Reported Performance Metrics**
- **EER:** ~1.85% (on AVspoof dataset)
- **Detection Accuracy:** 99% (synthetic vs. real speech classification)
- **Inference Speed:** Moderate (~120ms per sample with optimized inference pipelines).

### **Why This Approach?**
- **Enhanced Robustness:** Combines different features to improve generalization.
- **Better Adaptability:** Can be fine-tuned for different datasets.
- **Works on Real Conversations:** Can be optimized for streaming speech analysis.

### **Challenges & Limitations**
- **Computationally Intensive:** Needs more processing power due to multi-feature fusion.
- **Requires Model Optimization:** Can be complex to implement efficiently in real-time environments.

## Conclusion
Each approach has strengths and trade-offs:
- **For real-time performance:** **End-to-End Raw Audio Models** are preferable.
- **For balanced accuracy and efficiency:** **Hybrid Feature-Based Detection** is a strong candidate.
- **For robustness against varied deepfake attacks:** **Feature Fusion-Based Detection** provides the best generalization.

# ASVspoof Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a binary classification model to detect spoofed (fake) and real audio using deep learning. The model processes `.wav` files, extracts features, and classifies the audio using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by RawNet.

## Features
- Uses `librosa` for audio preprocessing.
- Fixed-length audio input for consistency.
- Binary classification with a simple 1D-CNN architecture.
- Trained using Binary Cross Entropy Loss (`BCELoss`).
- Includes accuracy calculation during training.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or later).

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio librosa numpy
```

## Dataset Preparation
1. **Folder Structure:**
   ```
   train/
   ├── real/   # Contains real audio samples
   └── fake/   # Contains spoofed audio samples
   ```
2. Place `.wav` files in the `real/` and `fake/` directories.

## Running the Model
### Training
Run the Python script to train the model:
```sh
python train.py
```
### Output
Each epoch prints:
```
Epoch 1, Loss: 0.4321, Accuracy: 78.12%
Epoch 2, Loss: 0.3876, Accuracy: 82.50%
...
Training complete!
```

## Model Details
- **Architecture:**
  - 1D Convolutional layer
  - ReLU activation
  - Fully connected output layer
  - Sigmoid activation for binary classification
- **Optimizer:** Adam (`lr=0.001`)
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross Entropy (`BCELoss`)

## Notes
- The model expects all audio files to be resampled to **8 kHz**.
- Audio samples should have a **fixed length** (default: 32000 samples).
- The training dataset must be balanced for better performance.

## Future Improvements
- Implement more complex architectures like RawNet2.
- Use data augmentation to improve generalization.
- Implement a real-time inference system.
